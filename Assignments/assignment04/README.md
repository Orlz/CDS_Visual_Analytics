**Assignment 4:** Classification Benchmarks
==========================================================================================

**Using Logistic Regression and a Neural Network**

This assignment takes the form of 2 python scripts which should be called dirctly from the commandline. The data used is the MNIST data found on openml. 
This is a subset of the larger NIST file which contains 60,000 images of handwritten digits with 784 features. 
Information regarding this dataset can be found here: https://www.openml.org/d/554

**lr-mnist.py**  This script uses multinomial logistic regression to classify images of handwritten digits into their correct digit group (from 0 to 9)

**nn-mnist.py**  This script employs a neural network to classify the same images of handwritten digits into their correct digit group (from 0 - 9) 

Parameters can be set on the commandline using argpase arguments. Instructions of these can be found in each
